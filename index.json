Here, we show microwave QPPs during a solar flare originating from quasi-periodic magnetic reconnection at the flare current sheet. They appear as two vertically detached but closely related sources with the brighter ones located at flare loops and the weaker ones along the stretched current sheet. Although the brightness temperatures of the two microwave sources differ greatly, they vary in phase with periods of about 10-20 s and 30-60 s. The gyrosynchrotron-dominated microwave spectra also present a quasi-periodic soft-hard-soft evolution. These results suggest that relevant high-energy electrons are accelerated by quasi-periodic reconnection, likely arising from the modulation of magnetic islands within the current sheet as validated by a 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation.","tags":[],"title":"Microwave Imaging of Quasi-Periodic Pulsations at Flare Current Sheet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yingjie Luo","Bin Chen","Sijie Yu","Marina Battaglia","Rohit Sharma"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671398127,"objectID":"07cb1ea9b1b0e75ca73f13c81bc7a786","permalink":"https://binchensun.github.io/publication/luo-2022/","publishdate":"2022-12-18T21:15:27.051766Z","relpermalink":"/publication/luo-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Flare-associated quasiperiodic pulsations (QPPs) in radio and X-ray wavelengths, particularly those related to nonthermal electrons, contain important information about the energy release and transport processes during flares. However, the paucity of spatially resolved observations of such QPPs with a fast time cadence has been an obstacle for us to further understand their physical nature. Here, we report observations of such a QPP event that occurred during the impulsive phase of a C1.8-class eruptive solar flare using radio imaging spectroscopy data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and complementary X-ray imaging and spectroscopy data. The radio QPPs, observed by the VLA in the 1-2 GHz with a subsecond cadence, are shown as three spatially distinct sources with different physical characteristics. Two radio sources are located near the conjugate footpoints of the erupting magnetic flux rope with opposite senses of polarization. One of the sources displays a QPP behavior with a ~ 5 s period. The third radio source, located at the top of the postflare arcade, coincides with the location of an X-ray source and shares a similar period of ~ 25-45 s. We show that the two oppositely polarized radio sources are likely due to coherent electron cyclotron maser emission. On the other hand, the looptop QPP source, observed in both radio and X-rays, is consistent with incoherent gyrosynchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission, respectively. We conclude that the concurrent, but spatially distinct QPP sources must involve multiple mechanisms which operate in different magnetic loop systems and at different periods.","tags":["\"1342\"","\"1496\"","\"1515\"","\"1522\"","\"1816\"","\"Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena\"","\"Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics\"","\"Solar flares\"","\"Solar oscillations\"","\"Solar radio emission\"","\"Solar radio flares\"","\"Solar x-ray flares\""],"title":"Multiple Regions of Nonthermal Quasiperiodic Pulsations during the Impulsive Phase of a Solar Flare","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prof. Bin Chen"],"categories":["News"],"content":"","date":1661299200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671382800,"objectID":"ca45ae1841ab30294b7cf780cce43a39","permalink":"https://binchensun.github.io/news/yingjie_2022/","publishdate":"2022-08-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/yingjie_2022/","section":"news","summary":"Yingjie Luo successfully defended his Ph.D. thesis on July 20, 2022.

However, where and how these X-ray-emitting electrons are accelerated remains unclear. Here we present the first model of the double coronal hard X-ray (HXR) sources, where electrons are accelerated by a pair of termination shocks driven by bidirectional fast reconnection outflows. We model the acceleration and transport of electrons in the flare region by numerically solving the Parker transport equation using velocity and magnetic fields from the macroscopic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a flux rope eruption. We show that electrons can be efficiently accelerated by the termination shocks and high-energy electrons mainly concentrate around the two shocks. The synthetic HXR emission images display two distinct sources extending to $$100 keV below and above the reconnection region, with the upper source much fainter than the lower one. The HXR energy spectra of the two coronal sources show similar spectral slopes, consistent with the observations. Our simulation results suggest that the flare termination shock can be a promising particle acceleration mechanism in explaining the double-source nonthermal emissions in solar flares.","tags":["\"1119\"","\"1496\"","\"1504\"","\"1517\"","\"1536\"","\"2086\"","\"Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena\"","\"Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics\"","\"Non-thermal radiation sources\"","\"Physics - Plasma Physics\"","\"Shocks\"","\"Solar flares\"","\"Solar magnetic reconnection\"","\"Solar particle emission\"","\"Solar x-ray emission\""],"title":"A Model of Double Coronal Hard X-Ray Sources in Solar Flares","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prof. Bin Chen"],"categories":["News"],"content":"Nature article is freely available at this link.

The coronal loop system that hosts the ELP emission is often different from the main flaring arcade, and the enhanced EUV emission therein may imply an additional heating process. However, the origin of the ELP remains rather unclear. Here we present the analysis of a C1.4 flare that features such an ELP, which is also observed in microwave wavelengths by the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array. Similar to the case of the ELP, we find a gradual microwave enhancement that occurs about 3 minutes after the main impulsive phase microwave peaks. Radio sources coincide with both foot points of the ELP loops and spectral fits on the time-varying microwave spectra demonstrate a clear deviation of the electron distribution from the Maxwellian case, which could result from injected nonthermal electrons or nonuniform heating to the footpoint plasma. We further point out that the delayed microwave enhancement suggests the presence of an additional heating process, which could be responsible for the evaporation of heated plasma that fills the ELP loops, producing the prolonged ELP emission.","tags":["\"1342\"","\"1476\"","\"1493\"","\"Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics\"","\"Solar extreme ultraviolet emission\"","\"Solar physics\"","\"Solar radio flares\""],"title":"Implications for Additional Plasma Heating Driving the Extreme-ultraviolet Late Phase of a Solar Flare with Microwave Imaging Spectroscopy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaocan Li","Fan Guo","Bin Chen","Chengcai Shen","Lindsay Glesener"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1654041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671398127,"objectID":"e0ba5c50ecfe067ae0a67cf8f2c9a37c","permalink":"https://binchensun.github.io/publication/li-2022-a/","publishdate":"2022-12-18T21:15:26.937339Z","relpermalink":"/publication/li-2022-a/","section":"publication","summary":"The X8.2-class limb flare on 2017 September 10 is among the best studied solar flare events owing to its great similarity to the standard flare model and the broad coverage by multiple spacecraft and ground-based observations.

In this work, we model the electron acceleration and transport in the early impulsive phase of this flare. We solve the Parker transport equation that includes the primary acceleration mechanism during magnetic reconnection in the large-scale flare region modeled by MHD simulations. We find that electrons are accelerated up to several MeV and fill a large volume of the reconnection region, similar to the observations shown in microwaves. The electron spatial distribution and spectral shape in the looptop region agree well with those derived from the microwave and hard X-ray emissions before magnetic islands grow large and dominate the acceleration. Future emission modelings using the electron maps will enable direct comparison with microwave and hard X-ray observations. These results shed new light on the electron acceleration and transport in a broad region of solar flares within a data-constrained realistic flare geometry.","tags":["\"1483\"","\"1496\"","\"1504\"","\"1544\"","\"826\"","\"Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics\"","\"Interplanetary particle acceleration\"","\"Physics - Plasma Physics\"","\"Physics - Space Physics\"","\"Solar corona\"","\"Solar flares\"","\"Solar magnetic reconnection\"","\"Space plasmas\""],"title":"Modeling Electron Acceleration and Transport in the Early Impulsive Phase of the 2017 September 10th Solar Flare","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregory D.

These distributions show a volume filled with only (or almost only) non-thermal electrons while being depleted of the thermal plasma, implying that all electrons have experienced a prominent acceleration there. This volume is isolated from a surrounding, more typical flare plasma of mainly thermal particles with a smaller proportion of non-thermal electrons.

A characteristic feature of magnetic reconnection is the production of fast reconnection outflow jets near the plasma Alfvén speeds1,2. In eruptive solar flares, dark finger-shaped plasma downflows moving toward the flare arcade have been commonly regarded as the principal observational evidence for such reconnection-driven outflows3,4. However, they often show a speed much slower than that expected in reconnection theories5,6, challenging the reconnection-driven energy-release scenario in standard flare models. Here we present a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics model of solar flares. By comparing the model predictions with the observed plasma downflow features, we conclude that these dark downflows are self-organized structures formed in a turbulent interface region below the flare termination shock where the outflows meet the flare arcade, a phenomenon analogous to the formation of similar structures in supernova remnants. This interface region hosts a myriad of turbulent flows, electron currents and shocks, crucial for flare energy release and particle acceleration.","tags":["\"Astrophysical magnetic fields\"","\"Solar physics\""],"title":"The Origin of Underdense Plasma Downflows Associated with Magnetic Reconnection in Solar Flares","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuqian Wei","Bin Chen","Sijie Yu","Haimin Wang","Ju Jing","Dale E.

Direct measurements for the magnetic field of flux ropes are crucial for understanding the triggering and energy release processes, yet they remain heretofore elusive. Here we report microwave imaging spectroscopy observations of an M1.4-class solar flare that occurred on 2017 September 6, using data obtained by the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array. This flare event is associated with a partial eruption of a twisted filament observed in H$α$ by the Goode Solar Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory. The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray signatures of the event are generally consistent with the standard scenario of eruptive flares, with the presence of double flare ribbons connected by a bright flare arcade. Intriguingly, this partial eruption event features a microwave counterpart, whose spatial and temporal evolution closely follow the filament seen in H$α$ and EUV. The spectral properties of the microwave source are consistent with nonthermal gyrosynchrotron radiation. Using spatially resolved microwave spectral analysis, we derive the magnetic field strength along the filament spine, which ranges from 600 to 1400 Gauss from its apex to the legs. The results agree well with the nonlinear force-free magnetic model extrapolated from the preflare photospheric magnetogram. We conclude that the microwave counterpart of the erupting filament is likely due to flare-accelerated electrons injected into the filament-hosting magnetic flux rope cavity following the newly reconnected magnetic field lines.","tags":["\"1119\"","\"1342\"","\"1483\"","\"1495\"","\"1496\"","\"1503\"","\"1522\"","\"Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics\""],"title":"Coronal Magnetic Field Measurements along a Partially Erupting Filament in a Solar Flare","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marina Battaglia","Rohit Sharma","Yingjie Luo","Bin Chen","Sijie Yu","Säm Krucker"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671398126,"objectID":"5efa440068c0a2ea89eb60e0bd7ef239","permalink":"https://binchensun.github.io/publication/battaglia-2021/","publishdate":"2022-12-18T21:15:26.294469Z","relpermalink":"/publication/battaglia-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Even small solar flares can display a surprising level of complexity regarding their morphology and temporal evolution. Many of their properties, such as energy release and electron acceleration can be studied using highly complementary observations at X-ray and radio wavelengths. We present X-ray observations from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager and radio observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) of a series of GOES A3.4-B1.6 class flares observed on 2013 April 23. The flares, as seen in X-ray and extreme ultraviolet, originated from multiple locations within active region NOAA 11726. A veritable zoo of different radio emissions between 1 GHz and 2 GHz was observed cotemporally with the X-ray flares. In addition to broadband continuum emission, broadband short-lived bursts and narrowband spikes, indicative of accelerated electrons, were observed. However, these sources were located up to 150$″$ away from the flaring X-ray sources but only some of these emissions could be explained as signatures of electrons that were accelerated near the main flare site. For other sources, no obvious magnetic connection to the main flare site could be found. These emissions likely originate from secondary acceleration sites triggered by the flare, but may be due to reconnection and acceleration completely unrelated to the cotemporally observed flare. Thanks to the extremely high sensitivity of the VLA, not achieved with current X-ray instrumentation, it is shown that particle acceleration happens frequently and at multiple locations within a flaring active region.","tags":["\"1342\"","\"1475\"","\"1496\"","\"1693\"","\"1816\"","\"Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena\"","\"Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics\""],"title":"Multiple Electron Acceleration Instances during a Series of Solar Microflares Observed Simultaneously at X-Rays and Microwaves","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew Goodbred","Yi-Hsin Liu","Bin Chen","Xiaocan Li"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630174326,"objectID":"304769850d216b36ec9ee280bce57d2e","permalink":"https://binchensun.github.io/publication/2021-ph-pl-28-h-2103-g/","publishdate":"2021-08-28T18:12:05.517415Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-ph-pl-28-h-2103-g/","section":"publication","summary":"The energy conversion rate in Petschek-type reconnection is modeled by parameterizing it with the reconnection rate and a dimensionless factor associated with the structure across the reconnection exhaust.

One of the most well-known shock types on the Sun are those driven by coronal mass ejections (e.g., Morosan et al. 2019). There is another type of shocks in solar flares, known as the \u0026ldquo;solar flare termination shocks,\u0026rdquo; which are often incorporated within the framework of the standard CSHKP solar flare model as a potential particle accelerator. Particularly, they have been depicted in some of the most well-known schematics of the standard flare model (Shibata+; Magara+; Yokoyama+; Mann+). However, these shocks have received limited attention in the literature, largely due to the scarcity of observational evidence as well as detailed modeling studies. This post briefly introduces a series of our recent works which (we hope!) have helped rejuvenate the study of such shocks.\nSolar Flare Termination Shock  A fast-mode \u0026ldquo;Termination Shock\u0026rdquo;, induced by super-magnetosonic plasma outflows, can form above the flare arcade.\n Magnetic reconnection, the \u0026ldquo;central engine\u0026rdquo; that powers solar flares, propels a pair of high-speed reconnection outflow jets from the reconnection site (upward and downward arrows in Fig. 1). A fast-mode shock can form at the top of flare arcade provided that the speeds of reconnection outflows exceed the local fast-mode magnetosonic speed when then impinge upon the arcade top. Such shocks can accelerate electrons to nonthermal energies (Tsuneta \u0026amp; Naito 1998; Guo et al. 2012) and can produce observable radio emissions (e.g., Aurass et al. 2002). Previously, in Chen et al. 2015, Science, we used observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to image a type of radio bursts called \u0026ldquo;stochastic spike bursts.\u0026rdquo; The radio centroids outline a dynamic shock surface, located at the ending point of fast plasma downflows and above a hard X-ray looptop source (Fig. 1). Most notably, the study showed a reduction of the accelerated electron population during a temporary disruption of the shock, implicating a crucial role the shock may play as an electron accelerator.\nFig. 1: Schematic of the flare termination shock and the associated radio bursts shown in A. The shock front outlined by the radio source centroids is shown in B. (Adapted from Chen et al. 2015)\nShocked Material  A shock can compress the material across its front with observable radio signatures.\n A shock can compress the material across the shock front, resulting in a denser plasma in its downstream region. Because the emission frequency of plasma radiation (that falls within radio wavelengths under conditions in the solar corona) scales with the square root of the plasma density, the radio emission frequency can be used as a probe for such plasma compression across shocks. In particular, the denser, downstream plasma will emit at a slightly higher frequency than its less dense upstream counterpart, causing a slight frequency separation in the radio spectrogram. Such a \u0026ldquo;split-band\u0026rdquo; feature has been previously observed in type II radio bursts associated with CME-driven shocks (e.g., Chrysaphi et al. 2018), although its origin is still under debate.\nIn Chen et al. 2019, we conducted a detailed study on such \u0026ldquo;split-band\u0026rdquo; feature associated with the same termination shock event reported in Chen+2015: in the spatially-resolved radio dynamic spectrum, they show as two closely spaced lanes with slightly different frequencies (see Fig. 4 in their paper). Thanks to VLA\u0026rsquo;s dynamic spectroscopic imaging capability, we can now image the split-band radio sources at both the shock upstream and downstream sides simultaneously. They are mostly co-spatial with each other, indicating that they are likely associated with the same shock front viewed nearly edge-on. The high-frequency source is located at a slightly lower height than the low-frequency source. This observation conforms very well with the shock upstream-downstream scenario, with a density compression ratio of around 1.8 (which corresponds to a shock Mach number of ~1.6).\nShock Seen from Another Perspective Recently, in a new study led by our graduate student Yingjie Luo (Luo et al. 2021), we reported VLA observations of another stochastic spike burst event from an eruptive solar flare viewed from a different perspective\u0026mdash;in Chen+2015, 2019, it was viewed by the VLA above the limb; this time, it was viewed against the solar disk. A happy coincidence was that one of NASA\u0026rsquo;s STEREO spacecraft was located at ~110 degrees west (or \u0026ldquo;ahead of\u0026rdquo;) Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit, which captured this event with a simultaneous limb view (Fig. 2). Using VLA\u0026rsquo;s spectral imaging of the spike burst source, combined with three-dimensional reconstruction of the flare arcade seen in two different perspectives, we found that the spike source was located well above the flare arcade.\nIt was somewhat surprising to find the spike source located at such a distance away from the EUV flare arcade. However, we identified a diffuse fan-like structure above the looptop in both the Earth view (seen by NASA\u0026rsquo;s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory) and the limb view by STEREO. They were likely associated with the newly reconnected field lines located below the termination shock, as suggested by a three-dimensional magnetodynamics (MHD) modeling work led by Chengcai Shen @ CfA (Shen et al. 2021, submitted).\nFig. 2: An eruptive solar flare observed by VLA, SDO, and STEREO from two different viewing perspectives. In SDO and VLA\u0026rsquo;s view, the flare was viewed against the disk (panel C), while in STEREO-A\u0026rsquo;s view, it is located at the limb (panel D). (Adapted from Luo et al. 2021)\nFig. 3: The termination shock, manifested as stochastic spike bursts in our interpretation, is found to be located above the solar flare arcade in both the disk- and limb-view perspective. (Adapted from Luo et al. 2021)\nTermination Shock as a Particle Accelerator Although pertinent observational evidence for termination shocks as a particle accelerator has been reported (e.g., the stochastic spike bursts, the above-the-looptop \u0026ldquo;Masuda\u0026rdquo; source, and looptop plasma flows), understanding the physical picture has been far from complete. Particularly, linking these observational signatures with electron acceleration and transport requires macroscopic particle and emission modeling in a realistic flare reconnection geometry. We are working with our collaborators from the Los Alamos National Lab, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Shandong University, and Dartmouth College to develop such a modeling framework to enable detailed observation\u0026ndash;modeling comparison. Recently, with the newly developed macroscopic models, a pair of studies led by Dr. Xiangliang Kong (Fig. 4; see Kong et al. 2019 and Kong et al. 2020) have demonstrated that a dynamic termination shock above the flare arcade can efficiently accelerate electrons to high energies with a power-law spectrum. We are now investigating the expected emission signatures from these shock-accelerated electrons and comparing them to the actual observations. Please stay tuned!\nFig. 4: Macroscopic MHD and particle modeling shows that electrons are accelerated when they cross the termination shock above the flare arcade.

Although the flare arcade and ribbons seen during the impulsive phase do not allow us to clearly understand how the observed spike source location is connected to the flare geometry, the cooling flare arcade observed 2 hr later suggests that the spikes are located in the above-the-loop-top region, where a termination shock presumably forms.","tags":["\"Solar flares\"","\"Shocks\"","\"Solar coronal mass ejections\"","\"Solar radio emission\"","\"Solar magnetic reconnection\"","\"Non-thermal radiation sources\"","\"Solar radio flares\"","\"Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics\""],"title":"Radio Spectral Imaging of an M8.4 Eruptive Solar Flare: Possible Evidence of a Termination Shock","type":"publication_copy"},{"authors":["S.

At the current sheet, opposing magnetic field lines approach, break, and reconnect. Consequently, the previously stored magnetic energy is released to power the eruption (often observed as a coronal mass ejection) and to produce flare emissions observable in virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio to X-rays. The released magnetic energy is also responsible for accelerating charged particles to nearly the speed of light.\nSolar astronomers have been able to infer the presence of such current sheets in solar flares. However, there has been heretofore no measurement of its magnetic properties. With this new study published in Nature Astronomy, Prof. Bin Chen of the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) and his colleagues used multi-frequency microwave imaging observations, provided by the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA; a 13-element antenna array operated by NJIT), to obtain measurements of the magnetic field of a current sheet in a large eruptive solar flare for the first time. Remarkably, the measured magnetic field matches closely with predictions in a well-known analytical model of the “standard” solar flare scenario as well as numerical simulations based on magnetohydrodynamics equations.\nThe measurements also reveal a magnetic, bottle-like structure—referred to as a “magnetic bottle”—located near the bottom of the current sheet and above the newly formed flare arcade (via magnetic reconnection). The study shows that, while a huge amount of magnetic energy is being pumped into the main body of the current sheet at an estimated rate of 10-100 billion trillion joules per second, 99% of the observed relativistic electrons concentrate at the bottom of the current sheet near the magnetic bottle.\nThis study suggests that, at least in the present event, the magnetic bottle appears to be crucial in producing or confining the relativistic electrons. These observations will inspire further observational, theoretical, and modeling studies on solar flare energy release and particle acceleration, which is main science topic of the NASA/NSF Heliophysics Science Drive Center SolFER collaboration.\nThe study was also highlighted by several agencies, institutions, and media outlets:\n NSF Research News: Researchers Offer Look Into \u0026lsquo;Central Engine\u0026rsquo; Powering a Solar Flare NJIT Press Release: Researchers Offer Unprecedented Look Into \u0026lsquo;Central Engine\u0026rsquo; Powering a Solar Flare Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics Press Release: CfA Scientists and Team Take a Look Inside the Central Engine of a Solar Flare for the First Time 中国科学院云南天文台 (Yunnan Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences): \u0026ldquo;新研究揭示太阳爆发中心能量释放区域的奥秘\u0026rdquo; Astronomy Magazine: Astronomers develop new method for predicting explosive solar flares  Reference\n“Measurement of magnetic field and relativistic electrons along a solar flare current sheet”, by Bin Chen, Chengcai Shen, Dale E.

We examine the region to the south of the main flare arcade, where there is data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode. We find that there are initial blueshifts of 20-60 km s$^-1$ observed in this region in the Fe XXI line in IRIS and the Fe XXIV line in EIS, and that the locations of these blueshifts move southward along the arcade over the course of about 10 minutes. The cadence of IRIS allows us to follow the evolution of these flows, and we find that at each location where there is an initial blueshift in the Fe XXI line, there are damped oscillations in the Doppler velocity with periods of ~400 s.

We examine the region to the south of the main flare arcade, where there is data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode. We find that there are initial blueshifts of 20-60 km s$^-1$ observed in this region in the Fe XXI line in IRIS and the Fe XXIV line in EIS, and that the locations of these blueshifts move southward along the arcade over the course of about 10 minutes. The cadence of IRIS allows us to follow the evolution of these flows, and we find that at each location where there is an initial blueshift in the Fe XXI line, there are damped oscillations in the Doppler velocity with periods of ~400 s.

Accelerated nonthermal electrons have often been invoked as the primary means for transporting the bulk of the released energy to the lower solar atmosphere. However, significant challenges remain for this scenario, especially in accounting for the large number of accelerated electrons inferred from observations. Propagating magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) waves, particularly those with subsecond/second-scale periods, have been proposed as an alternative means for transporting the released flare energy, likely alongside the electron beams, while observational evidence remains elusive. Here we report a possible detection of such waves in the late impulsive phase of a two-ribbon flare. This is based on ultrahigh cadence dynamic imaging spectroscopic observations of a peculiar type of decimetric radio bursts obtained by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Radio imaging at each time and frequency pixel allows us to trace the spatiotemporal motion of the source, which agrees with the implications of the frequency drift pattern in the dynamic spectrum. The radio source, propagating at 1000-2000 km s$^-1$ in projection, shows close spatial and temporal association with transient brightenings on the flare ribbon.

Accelerated nonthermal electrons have often been invoked as the primary means for transporting the bulk of the released energy to the lower solar atmosphere. However, significant challenges remain for this scenario, especially in accounting for the large number of accelerated electrons inferred from observations. Propagating magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) waves, particularly those with subsecond/second-scale periods, have been proposed as an alternative means for transporting the released flare energy, likely alongside the electron beams, while observational evidence remains elusive. Here we report a possible detection of such waves in the late impulsive phase of a two-ribbon flare. This is based on ultrahigh cadence dynamic imaging spectroscopic observations of a peculiar type of decimetric radio bursts obtained by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Radio imaging at each time and frequency pixel allows us to trace the spatiotemporal motion of the source, which agrees with the implications of the frequency drift pattern in the dynamic spectrum. The radio source, propagating at 1000-2000 km s$^-1$ in projection, shows close spatial and temporal association with transient brightenings on the flare ribbon. In addition, multitudes of subsecond-period oscillations are present in the radio emission. We interpret the observed radio bursts as short-period MHD wave packets propagating along newly reconnected magnetic flux tubes linking to the flare ribbon.

These hot flows, as indicated by the blueshifted Fe xxi 1354.08 ̊A line, evolve smoothly with a velocity decreasing exponentially from ~200 km s$^-1$ to almost stationary within a few minutes.

Usual fine structures in emission such as spikes, zebra stripes, and drifting fibers were observed at the peak of every new flare brightening. Within an hour at the decay phase of the event we observed bursts consisting of spikes in absorption, which pulsated periodically in frequency. Their instantaneous frequency bandwidths were found to be in the 75 MHz range. Moreover, in the strongest Type III-like bursts in absorption, the spikes showed stripes of the zebra-pattern (ZP) that drifted to higher frequencies.

Usual fine structures in emission such as spikes, zebra stripes, and drifting fibers were observed at the peak of every new flare brightening. Within an hour at the decay phase of the event we observed bursts consisting of spikes in absorption, which pulsated periodically in frequency. Their instantaneous frequency bandwidths were found to be in the 75 MHz range. Moreover, in the strongest Type III-like bursts in absorption, the spikes showed stripes of the zebra-pattern (ZP) that drifted to higher frequencies. All spikes had the duration as short as down to the limit of the instrument resolution of ensuremath≈8 ms.
